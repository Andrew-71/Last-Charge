# WaveSurvivalGame
A simple top-down shooter written in Python using PyGame

#!!! This is description as of prototype stage, everything is a subject to change !!!

# What (should) be implemented by end of development.
1. Mechanic of enemies spawning in waves
2. Enemies with random movement who target you when they see you
3. Amazing pixel art graphics (will add as soon as I'll buy aseprite)
4. 8-bit sounds
5. Several similar but just enough different square arenas
6. Upgrades like bullet time
7. Much more but I ran out of ideas!

# Placeholder description
So, you appear in the middle of a Colosseum. But it's square. 
You sign at developer's laziness, but suddenly several monsters start running at you. Well, float. Because they are colourful blobs.
Around the arena there are several spawners that make ammo boxes appear from time to time. What is sci fi tech doing in rome? Why is a full box just 20 bullets?
So many questions, but not enough time to answer. Except there is, because there is also bullet time for some reason! Why? Because its fun and I was bored
