# You're a lowlife!
# You don't feel a thing do you?
# A machine, that's what you are!
# You're just a fucking machine!

# Of course I'm a machine lieutenant.
# What else did you think I was?

# Nothing in their program allows them to love or desire anything.
# They're machines.

# =====================================

# What's up, lieutenant?
# Ran out of whiskey and came looking for trouble instead?

# =====================================

# Why, Connor?
# Why did you have to wake up when all you had to do was obey?

# =====================================

# You can't kill me.
# I'm not alive.

# =====================================

# Moment of truth Connor.
# What are you gonna do?

# =====================================

# Still immortal huh Connor?

# In a way.

# =====================================
